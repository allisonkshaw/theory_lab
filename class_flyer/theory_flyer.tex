Theory can help us reason through biological questions and provide rigorous connections between causal processes and observable patterns.
This class (a.k.a.\ `theory group') provides a forum for feedback on ongoing modeling work.
Each week is a discussion between the presenter(s) who describe their own work in progress, and everyone else who asks questions and offers suggestions.
